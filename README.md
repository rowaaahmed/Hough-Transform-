# Hough-Transform-
This part of the project addresses road lane detection from images using the Hough Transform for robust line extraction. The implemented pipeline processes the input image to identify prominent linear features corresponding to lane markings. The final output visualizes the detection results by overlaying the extracted lane lines onto the original image.
